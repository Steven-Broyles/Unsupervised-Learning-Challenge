Analysis: Based on our analysis of this data clustering may not be a meaningful tool to help explain our Crypto Data. The TSNE plot shows 1 distinct cluster with a couple of outlier points scattered outside and our KMeans plot showed no true "elbow" suggesting that clustering with this data set may not be useful.
